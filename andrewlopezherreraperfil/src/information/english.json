I really like the career I am pursuing; I have always had an affinity for computers, so I didn't hesitate much when entering this field. I consider myself a person who easily adapts to changes, so working in different teams is not a problem for me. Additionally, I am very interested in topics such as compilers and interpreters, artificial intelligence, robotics, and cybersecurity. I tend to lead my teammates to achieve a common goal, although I have no problem having a good leader who also guides me towards an objective."
